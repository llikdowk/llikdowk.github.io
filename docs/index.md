# Welcome!

As I develop new features I tend to forget the tricky bits of the ones I've already developed so I decided to build this page so:

1. I stop wasting my time
1. You can learn too if for some reason you found this in your journey

I hope it's going to be as useful to you as it's going to be for me.

!!! Note "I'm learning on the go"
    This page is going to be quite rough for a while so bear with me until I figure things out.
