# Welcome!

Hi all! I'm llikdowk and I've been coding professionally for unreal for quite a long time now.
Not so long ago I decided to go indie though, and now I'm not only coding but also designing & responsible of the tech-art side of the games we're making as [SelkieHarbour](https://twitter.com/SelkieHarbour).

So, as I develop new features I tend to forget the tricky bits of the ones I've already developed so I decided to build this page so:

1. I stop wasting my time
1. You can learn too if for some reason you found this in your journey. I hope you find it interesting and/or helpful.

I hope it's going to be as useful to you as it's going to be for me.

!!! Note "I'm learning on the go"
    This page is going to be quite rough for a while so bear with me until I figure things out.

Have a nice day! ðŸ¤™
